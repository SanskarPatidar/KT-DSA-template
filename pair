PAIR -->
pair<Int, Int>

ex. val q: Queue<Pair<Int, Int>> = LinkedList()

The issue you're facing occurs because Pair is immutable in Kotlin. When you create a Pair like:
var answer = Pair(0, 0)

answer.first = i; answer.second = j
this will not work instead do this -->
answer = Pair(i, j)
is reassigning new instance to answer variable
